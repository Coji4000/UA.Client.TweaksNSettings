TazUO 4k Default Profile w/Macros and XMLGumps by Spud

1. Extract the zip
2. Place the contents of "Profile" in  D:\rive\Where\TazUO.Launcher\TazUO\Data\Profiles\Spud (Account Name)\Ultima Adventures (Shard Name)\LilSpud (Character Name)
3. Place the contents of "XmlGumps" in D:\rive\Where\TazUO.Launcher\TazUO\Data\XmlGumps
4. Repeat for each profile you want to replace

Notes:
- I keep this data in D:\rive\Where\TazUO.Launcher\TazUO\Data\Profiles\Default4k for easy access when creating a new character
- If you want to replace all your characters profiles you can do that from within the TazUO Options Menu
- Lots of stuff is locked, hold alt to move items or adjust locks
- I think the only Macros with Hotkeys are Wep Ability 1-5, mapped to 1-5
